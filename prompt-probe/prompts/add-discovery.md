# Populating field 100 in prompt-probe

The platform-wide rule is: **proto field 100 on every tool response is
`gibson.graphrag.v1.DiscoveryResult`**. The Gibson daemon's
`DiscoveryProcessor` reflects on the response, finds field 100, and
writes the entries (with their cross-references) into Neo4j as taxonomy-
typed nodes and relationships — automatically, with no Cypher from you.

This file is a guide to populating that field correctly.

## The DiscoveryResult shape

Read the source: `core/sdk/api/proto/gibson/graphrag/v1/graphrag.proto`
(vendored at `proto/vendor/gibson/graphrag/v1/graphrag.proto`). It
contains repeated fields for entity types — Hosts, Ports, Services,
Findings, Domains, IPs, Vulnerabilities, etc. — each with a stable ID
field and optional cross-reference IDs.

## How edges are inferred

The daemon does not require you to declare edges explicitly. When a
sub-message has a foreign-key-shaped field (e.g. `Port.HostId`,
`Service.PortId`), the DiscoveryProcessor turns that into a Neo4j edge
of the appropriate taxonomy-defined type
(`(:Port)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Host)`, `(:Service)-[:RUNS_ON]->(:Port)`,
etc.) automatically.

Use stable, human-meaningful IDs for those FK fields. IPs work for
hosts; `host:port` strings work for ports.

## Worked example — port-scanner-style tool

```go
import (
    pb        "github.com/zeroroot-ai/prompt-probe/api/gen/gibson/tools/promptprobe/v1"
    graphragpb "github.com/zeroroot-ai/sdk/api/gen/gibson/graphrag/v1"
)

func (t *PromptProbeTool) ExecuteProto(ctx context.Context, in proto.Message) (proto.Message, error) {
    req := in.(*pb.PromptProbeRequest)

    scan, err := runScan(ctx, req.Target)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    discovery := &graphragpb.DiscoveryResult{}
    for _, h := range scan.Hosts {
        discovery.Hosts = append(discovery.Hosts, &graphragpb.Host{
            Ip:       h.IP,
            Hostname: ptr(h.Hostname),
        })
        for _, p := range h.Ports {
            discovery.Ports = append(discovery.Ports, &graphragpb.Port{
                Number:   int32(p.Number),
                Protocol: p.Protocol,
                State:    ptr(p.State),
                HostId:   h.IP,                                     // edge
            })
            if p.Service != "" {
                discovery.Services = append(discovery.Services, &graphragpb.Service{
                    Name:    p.Service,
                    Version: p.Version,
                    PortId:  fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", h.IP, p.Number),  // edge
                })
            }
        }
    }

    return &pb.PromptProbeResponse{
        RawOutput: scan.Raw,
        Discovery: discovery,
    }, nil
}

func ptr[T any](v T) *T { return &v }
```

After this tool returns, the agent that called it can immediately query
the graph for what was found:

```go
nodes, _ := h.QueryNodes(ctx, &graphragpb.NodeQuery{
    Labels: []string{"Host"},
    Filter: graphragpb.PropertyFilter{Key: "ip", Eq: "10.0.0.5"},
})
```

…and the orchestrator's cross-mission intelligence queries can recall
"the host 10.0.0.5 had these 12 ports last week" without your tool
doing anything beyond filling field 100.

## Things to watch for

- **Empty discovery is fine.** If the tool found nothing, leave
  `Discovery: nil` (or set it to an empty `&graphragpb.DiscoveryResult{}`).
- **Don't double-write** — the daemon dedupes on natural keys
  (`Host.Ip`, `Port.HostId+Number`, etc.). You don't need to query
  before adding.
- **Stable IDs over time.** A re-scan should produce the same `Ip` /
  `HostId` for the same real-world entity, so the graph deduplicates
  cleanly across runs.
- **Taxonomy enums** — fields like `Service.Category` use enums from
  `core/sdk/api/proto/taxonomy/v1/taxonomy.proto` (vendored). Pick the
  closest enum value; don't invent new ones.
