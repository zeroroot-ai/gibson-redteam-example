# Debugging llm-redteam enrollment

`gibson component register` does three things in order. If it fails,
the error message names which step.

## 1. OIDC discovery

The CLI fetches `${GIBSON_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration` to
discover the issuer + audience. Failures look like
`enroll: OIDC discovery failed: ...`.

- **Connectivity** — `curl -sS ${GIBSON_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration`
  should return JSON.
- **TLS** — if you're behind a corporate proxy or self-signed CA, the
  CLI uses Go's default cert pool. Add the CA to your system trust
  store; `--insecure` is not supported.

## 2. Credentials file write

The CLI writes `~/.gibson/agent/credentials` with mode 0600. Failures
look like `enroll: write credentials: ...`.

- The credentials file lives at `~/.gibson/agent/credentials`. With
  `--name <install>`, the path becomes
  `~/.gibson/agent/credentials.<install>` so multiple agent installs
  can co-exist on one host.
- If a file already exists with a **different** `client_id`, the CLI
  refuses without `--force`. Re-running with the same `client_id` is a
  no-op success.

## 3. OAuth2 token exchange

The CLI mints a `client_credentials` token against
`${issuer}/oauth/v2/token`. Failures:

- **`credentials rejected by IdP at <issuer>`** — wrong `client_id` or
  `client_secret`. Re-issue from the dashboard.
- **`IdP at <issuer> denied the credential (403)`** — the principal is
  disabled. Tenant admin must re-enable in the dashboard.
- **`token exchange failed against <issuer>`** — connectivity or proxy
  problem. Verify with
  `curl -X POST ${issuer}/oauth/v2/token -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' -u "${client_id}:${client_secret}"`.

## After successful register

```sh
gibson inspect
```

Auto-detects `~/.gibson/agent/credentials`, calls
`IdentityService.WhoAmI`, and prints your effective grants. If
`components` is empty, your tenant admin may have minted the principal
but not granted it any component access yet.

## Reading the on-disk shape

```sh
jq . ~/.gibson/agent/credentials
```

Fields: `issuer`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `audience`,
`gibson_url`. Defined at `core/sdk/auth/oidc/agent_credentials.go`. The
SDK refuses to load the file if its mode permissions are looser than
0600 (`ErrInsecureCredentialFile`).
